## Overview: Science Meets Systems Engineering

This repository documents a 103-day experiment (2025-W17 to W36) where systematic, data-driven interventions produced measurable physiological improvements:

| Metric | Baseline (W17) | Final (W32) | Δ Change |
|--------|----------------|-------------|----------|
| **Efficiency Factor** | 0.0180 | 0.0212 | **+18%** |
| **Aerobic Decoupling** | 7.7% | 3.8% | **-50.6%** |
| **Average Pace** | 5:03/km | 4:18/km | **-15%** |
| **Cadence** | 164 spm | 170 spm | **+6 spm** |
| **Environmental Conditions** | 20°C (mild) | 36°C (extreme heat) | **Handicap** |

**The Innovation:** This isn't just about the performance gains—it's about the **reproducible software pipeline** that made systematic measurement, intervention, and validation possible.

### Visual Evidence: The Progression

**Efficiency Factor Over Time:**

![EF Progression](docs/images/ef_progression.png)

*RPE 10 maximal effort test-retest comparison showing systematic improvement over 103 days: Baseline diagnosis → Heat stress validation → Biomechanical intervention → Performance breakthrough. The +18% improvement was achieved while running in 36°C heat (vs 20°C baseline), demonstrating true physiological adaptation.*

**Aerobic Decoupling: Thermal Resilience:**

![Aerobic Decoupling](docs/images/aerobic_decoupling.png)

*Cardiac drift under thermal stress decreased from 19.78% @ 32°C (Week 23) to 4.71% @ 27°C (Week 35), demonstrating heat adaptation and improved aerobic efficiency.*

## Quick Start

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/ImmortalDemonGod/bio-systems-engineering.git
cd bio-systems-engineering

# Create virtual environment
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate

# Install package in editable mode with dev dependencies
pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

### Docker (Recommended for Reproducibility)

```bash
# Build the image
docker build -t biosystems:latest .

# Run analysis on sample data
docker run -v $(pwd)/data:/app/data biosystems:latest

# Or run on your own data (place .gpx/.fit files in data/raw/)
docker run -v $(pwd)/data:/app/data -v /path/to/your/gpx:/app/data/raw biosystems:latest
```

### Try It Out: Demo with Sample Data

The repository includes **anonymized sample data** to demonstrate the pipeline without requiring your own GPS files.

```python
import pandas as pd
from biosystems.physics.metrics import run_metrics
from biosystems.models import ZoneConfig, HeartRateZone

# Load the included sample run
df = pd.read_csv('data/sample/sample_run.csv', parse_dates=['time'])

# Define heart rate zones
zones = ZoneConfig(
    resting_hr=50,
    threshold_hr=186,
    zones={
        "Z2": HeartRateZone(
            name="Z2 (Aerobic)",
            bpm=(145, 165),
            pace_min_per_km=(4.5, 6.0)
        )
    }
)

# Calculate metrics
metrics = run_metrics(df, zones)
print(f"Efficiency Factor: {metrics.efficiency_factor:.5f}")
print(f"Aerobic Decoupling: {metrics.decoupling_pct:.2f}%")
print(f"Training Stress Score: {metrics.hr_tss:.1f}")
```

**Output:**
```
Efficiency Factor: 0.02162
Aerobic Decoupling: 3.33%
Training Stress Score: 42.8
```

### Using Your Own Data

```python
from biosystems.ingestion.gpx import parse_gpx
from biosystems.physics.metrics import run_metrics

# Parse your activity file
df = parse_gpx("data/raw/my_run.gpx")

# Calculate metrics (using same zones as above)
metrics = run_metrics(df, zones)
```

**Supported Formats:**
- `.gpx` (Garmin, Strava exports)
- `.fit` (Garmin native format)

## Key Findings: The "Black Box" Investigation

The project's technical report documents a systematic progression through four phases:

### Phase A: The Diagnosis (Weeks 17-20)
**Discovery:** High volume training, stagnant performance  
**Data:** EF = 0.016, Cadence = 155 spm  
**Insight:** *"The engine works, but the chassis is inefficient"*

### Phase B: The Crucible (Weeks 21-24)
**Event:** Environmental stress test  
**Data:** Week 23 @ 32.3°C → 19.78% decoupling  
**Insight:** *"System breakdown under thermal load validates instrumentation sensitivity"*

### Phase C: The Intervention (Weeks 25-31)
**Strategy:** Biomechanical re-patterning (NME drills)  
**Data:** Cadence gradually shifts 158 → 165 spm  
**Insight:** *"Deliberate neuromuscular training"*

### Phase D: The Breakthrough (Weeks 32-36)
**Outcome:** Performance ceiling shattered  
**Data:** Week 32 RPE 10 Retest: EF = 0.0212, 4:18/km pace, 170 spm, 3.8% decoupling @ 36°C (extreme heat)  
**Insight:** *"Systemic adaptation + heat resilience confirmed"*

## The Methodology: Run-Only Filter

**The Critical Innovation:**

Traditional running analytics (Strava, Garmin) average across entire activities—including warm-ups, cool-downs, and traffic stops. This pollutes physiological metrics.

Our solution: **The Run-Only Filter**

```python
# From biosystems/physics/metrics.py
lz2 = lower_z2_bpm(zones)  # Lower bound of Zone 2
work_df = df[df['hr'] >= lz2]  # Filter: Only data where HR ≥ Z2

# Calculate Efficiency Factor on pure running signal
ef = (work_df['dist'].sum() / work_df['dt'].sum()) / work_df['hr'].mean()
```

**Why This Matters:**
- Mathematically removes recovery periods
- Validates claim: *"Gains are from running performance, not just moving"*
- Separates this study from casual analytics

**Example Validation:**
- Total session: 59 minutes
- Isolated running: 39 minutes @ Z2+
- **Filter precision: 66% signal extraction**

## Transparent Limitations

This study explicitly acknowledges:

1. **N=1 design:** Results demonstrate feasibility, not generalizability
2. **Single-subject data:** Findings reflect one individual's physiology and training response
3. **No heat adjustment algorithm:** Performance gains likely **underestimated** (improvement occurred despite higher thermal stress)
4. **Missing power data:** Power metrics excluded from analysis
5. **Route consistency assumption:** Analysis assumes topographically similar training routes (GAP implemented but not applied to historical data)

**Framing:** These limitations are transparently disclosed. The **18% improvement** (from RPE 10 baseline test 0.0180 to RPE 10 retest 0.0212) represents a scientifically valid maximal effort test-retest comparison, demonstrating true physiological adaptation despite the final test occurring in extreme heat (36°C vs 20°C baseline).

## The Vision: System as Contribution

This project positions the **software pipeline itself** as a primary research contribution:

> *"We didn't just run; we built a machine to measure the running."*

Traditional sports science relies on manual logging, proprietary platforms, or expensive lab equipment. This repository demonstrates:

1. **Automated ETL** - From raw GPS → validated metrics
2. **Reproducible Environment** - Docker + requirements.txt
3. **Rigorous Filtering** - Run-Only algorithm for signal purity
4. **Privacy-Safe Design** - No GPS coordinates, only derived time-series

**The broader goal:** Make N=1 self-experimentation practical, reproducible, and suitable for publication rather than just anecdotal.

## Development History & Validation

### Historical Context

The physiological improvements documented in this study (W17-W36, 2025) were tracked using prototype analysis scripts in the parent `Holistic-Performance-Enhancement` monorepo. This repository represents a **production-grade refactoring** of that analysis methodology, with significant architectural improvements:

- **Structured Package Architecture** - Modular `biosystems` package vs loose scripts
- **Comprehensive Test Suite** - 149 tests across Python 3.10/3.11/3.12 with automated CI validation
- **Strict Data Contracts** - Pydantic models for type safety
- **Enhanced Features** - Grade Adjusted Pace (GAP) calculation added
- **Privacy Protection** - GPS sanitization tools and comprehensive `.gitignore`

### Validation

The library is designed to reproduce the results of the prototype scripts. A dedicated validation harness will compare key metrics (Efficiency Factor, Aerobic Decoupling, Training Stress Score) across both implementations to confirm matching behavior within expected floating-point tolerances, while the refactoring improves code quality, testability, and maintainability.

### Future Use

This library represents the canonical implementation for all future running performance analysis. It formalizes the methodology used in the longitudinal study and provides a reproducible, well-documented system for N=1 performance optimization research.
