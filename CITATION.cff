abstract: >
  A Python library and research artifact for systematic human performance 
  optimization using MLOps principles. Documents a 103-day longitudinal N=1 
  study demonstrating an 18.4% improvement in running Efficiency Factor through
  data-driven biomechanical intervention. Includes a reproducible software pipeline
  for parsing GPS activity files, calculating physiological metrics, and generating
  publication-quality analyses.
