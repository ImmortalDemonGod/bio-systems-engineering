Physics Module
==============

Algorithms for calculating physiological and biomechanical metrics.

Core Metrics:
- Efficiency Factor (EF): Speed / Heart Rate
- Aerobic Decoupling: HR drift over time (Pa:HR)
- Training Stress Score (TSS): Quantified training load
- Grade Adjusted Pace (GAP): Normalized pace accounting for elevation
